## Statings at pushing it
Simple AI to drive a car through the different scenes.
Those scenes were created on the robot simulator CoppeliaSim (old V-REP). You can found them on the n4s dir.

## How works the program
You have to run CoppeliaSim and open a scene located on n4s/scenes.
Thene, bild the program using the makefile and locate it on n4s/.
Onche there, you run the script pipes.sh, this script is charged to get the output of ai program,
and send it to n4s, the program who will communicate with CoppeliaSim.

## Future projections
Get the AI to road the scenes more quickly and implementing a backward state in case there is a crash.
